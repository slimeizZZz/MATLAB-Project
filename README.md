<h1>MATLAB Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists in an Arduino project with a simple circuit configured by an ESP32. The circuit consists in a button that turns on a LED once a second when pressed once. The MatLab code reads the serial from the arduino code that the port is transfering and it plots an animated live graph that displays the behavior of the LED (turning on and off and at what moment).1 represents ON, while 0 represents OFF.
